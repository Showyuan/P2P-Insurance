**Overview**

The P2P Pet Insurance Smart Contract is a decentralized application (DApp) that aims to provide a peer-to-peer platform for pet owners to participate in a trustless and transparent insurance program for their pets. Inspired by the concept of sharing economy and mutual aid organizations, P2P insurance operates on the principle of sharing losses and sharing benefits among a group of members.
